While we aren't hosting the Okta Sign-In Widget when we use the Redirect Model, our sample applications ***do*** call out to Okta's API to close an Okta session and log a user out. Every website origin must be explicitly permitted as a **Trusted Origin** in your Okta org. \n\n1. Ensure you are logged in to the Admin Dashboard as Super Admin.\n\n2. In the Admin menu, navigate to **Security** > **API**\n\n3. Select on the **Trusted Origins**  tab.\n\n4. Select the **Add Origin** button\n\n5.
